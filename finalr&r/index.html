                <span class="bold-heading">Critiqued by</span> 
                Nanette Ta: Design Lead at #Include, a design and developing student agency at UC Davis, with multiple case studies and internships in UI/UX design and branding. <br>

                Jolina Huang: Design Lead at Codelab, a design and developing student agency at UC Davis. Worked with multiple local companies and UI/UX agencies. Winner of the 2023 Davis hackathon and 2024 Design Interactive designathon. <br>

                <span class="bold-heading">Design critique notes: What is strong and what can be improved in terms of visual design for the project.</span> <br>
                Jolina suggested making transitions more fluid by integrating subtle easing to enhance the polished feel of the experience, while Nanette recommended reducing transition time to allow for quicker interactions without sacrificing the cinematic effect. Both reviewers pointed out that the hover effects could be more seamlessly integrated, especially when transitioning between highlighted areas. They also cautioned against a visual overload, advising careful balance between visual effects and usability to avoid overwhelming users.<br>
